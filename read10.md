# Debbuging 
_there is no 100% right code because writing code in JS can cause some errors and its possible to do that_
*what??*
_its catcting errors basically , the interpreter executes lines of code and catch errors that developer see in the console and it uses **execution contexts** that corresponds the scope of variables and it uses concept of stack to reserve data and call it again after_
*why?*
_it helps developers fixing code and understand errors , understanding scopes and how code behaves > if the error is not handled, the script will just stop processing and the user will not know why. So exception-handling code should 
inform users when there is a problem_. 
*how*
_two ways_ :

| debbug  |try and catch |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|  tracking down the source   | error handling code     |
|  deduction and eliminating  |   writing a block of code that executed anyway   |
_two ways to catch problems in coding by either using keywords consoleing the code to see in the console errors or the block try and catch and finally blocks if your code might fail so use them instead to fix_

# other ways handling errors
- searching .
