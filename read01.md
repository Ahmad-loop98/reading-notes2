# scripts .

* set of instructions that a computer follows so that it acheives a goal to the user it is like a manual , a browser which follows instructions usually use different parts based on a user behavior .

> It is worth noting, however, that a computer doesn't 
learn how to perform tasks like you or I might; it 
needs to follow instructions every time it performs 
the task. So a program must give the computer 
enough detail to perform the task as if every time 
were its first time.

* it is important to define a goal then splitting goal into subgoals so you handle it and then start coding these coding can be translated into lines of code and that code is read sequentially by the computer which behave to the real world by data by objects , events and characteristics
