# Having good team

## Google experience

_After years of analyzing data and interviews from more than 180 teams across google company, Google found that the kinds of people who have individual personalities in a team are not so relevant._

**two different kinds of groups and people**

1.Group A: who are professionals and aim to work all the time without having rest or even putting a joke or speak or make a conversation for minutes.
2.Group B:less proffeciency and teammates jump in and out of discussions when someone starts a conversation all of members go and start talking .

_In my opinion a member should pick a group based on his relax if he wanted and aim to work with a group of people even as group B , the group will work and make a real project and a nice one but also there are some characteristics of teams a member should consider such simplicity and clarity , solving a real problem , collaboration , code of conduct between each member ,Psychological safety that all feels free to take some risks and reaching the goal of a project you do_
